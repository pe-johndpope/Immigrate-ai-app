    question: "How can I extend my stay as a student?",
    answer: `
      If you want to study in Canada longer, you need to extend your study permit. 
      You should apply to extend your study permit at least 30 days before your current permit expires. 
      However, we recommend you apply more than 30 days before it expires. If you need to renew your Social Insurance Number (SIN) or health insurance, you need a valid study permit. 
      If you wait until there are only 30 days left, you may have problems renewing these because your study permit will be expiring.

    question:
      "What does “adequate knowledge” of English or French mean when applying for citizenship?",
    answer: `The Citizenship Act requires that citizenship applicants have “an adequate knowledge of one of the official languages of Canada.” 
      Canada’s two official languages are English and French. 
      We define “adequate knowledge” as having a Level 4 speaking and listening ability. 
      To measure your ability, we use the Canadian Language Benchmarks (CLB) or Niveaux de compétence linguistique canadien (NCLC).
