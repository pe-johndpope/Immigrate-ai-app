In both cases, we send you instructions on when and how to get your medical exam done.\nDo not go for your medical exam unless we tell you to.\nFirst medical exam\nAs a caregiver, you work in close contact with children, disabled people or the elderly, so you need to take a medical exam before you can come to Canada to work. \nSecond medical exam\nOnce you have 24 months of work experience in Canada, and submit proof of your work experience, you may be asked to take another medical exam to make sure you're still admissible to Canada.\nFamily members\nYour family members must take and pass a medical exam even if they're not coming with you to Canada. If they don't, they won't be eligible to be sponsored in the future.

You can use work experience from more than 1 employer to apply for the Home Child Care Provider or Home Support Worker Pilots as long as that work experience is in the same eligible occupation.\nYou can't combine work experience from 2 different occupations.\nDepending on which pilot you apply for, your work experience must be in 1 of these National Occupational Classification (NOC) jobs:\n\nHome child care provider - NOC 4411 (experience as a foster parent doesn't count)\nHome support worker - NOC 4412 (experience as a housekeeper doesn't count)\n\nFor example, if you worked full-time as a home child care provider for 2 different employers, you can use that work experience towards your eligibility. \nHowever, if you worked full-time as a home child care provider for 1 employer and as a home support worker for another employer, you can't combine that work experience."

However, you may be eligible for Employment Insurance (EI) benefits while you look for another job. If so, EI will provide you with benefits if you lose your job through no fault of your own. The number of hours you must work before you qualify for EI will depend on the unemployment rate in your region when you file a claim for benefits.\nYou may also be eligible for EI benefits that are provided at certain times when you are unable to work. This includes sickness, maternity, parental and compassionate care benefits.\nWhile you are working, your employer deducts EI premiums from your wages.
