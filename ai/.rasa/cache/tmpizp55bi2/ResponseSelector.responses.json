You must sign this form to prove you were given the health service or product.\n\n\nNote:\n\nBefore using any services, ask if the provider takes part in the Interim Federal Health Program (IFHP) and agrees to send their bill to Medavie Blue Cross.\nYou don’t have to accept services from health-care providers who don’t take part in the IFHP. For example, if a pharmacy asks you to pay for medication, you can find another pharmacy that is registered with the IFHP.\nIf you go to a pharmacy that is not located in your province of residence (e.g. if you live in Ontario and request a prescription medication in Quebec), your claim may be rejected. Make sure that you tell us if you move to another province.\nIf you are eligible for coverage for the service or product under the IFHP, you won’t have to pay for it. \nIf you pay a provider for a service or product that is covered by the IFHP, you won’t get any money back.\nIf you need a health-care service or product that isn’t covered you will have to pay for it.\n\n\nFind out more about how to get health services and products."
